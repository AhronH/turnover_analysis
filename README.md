# turnover_analysis
Hey everyone,
I'm happy to share a recent project I've been working on. This project involves analyzing employee turnover data to determine their causes over time. The data is longitudinal, which means the same person is recorded every year. This makes analyzing it a new experience to me.

The project involved leveraging Python and PowerBI to create an interactive dashboard that offers insights and visualizations of the terminated employees within 10 years time, covering a span from 2006 to 2015.

Utilizing Python's data manipulation capabilities in Anaconda, I processed and cleaned the collected data from Kaggle. From there I performed basic visualizations to glance at notable information. The Python libraries I've used include: pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. They allowed me to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset which I used later on PowerBI. I have also used numpy to try calculating the coefficients between variables, but so far did not succeed.

You can explore the dashboard here: https://mavenanalytics.io/project/6827

Key insights from analysis:
 - Of every 3 employees who left, 2 were females.
 - Departments that require manual labor oversaw the highest figure of terminated employees -> suggest looking further into their salary, promotion, etc.
 - There was a spike of spike of employees laid off from 2014-2015.
 - Retirement is the major cause for termination, with most employees under that cause reach the age of 60+

Feel free to dive in, click around, and explore the insights and visualizations. It's been a fun and rewarding experience working on this project and I'm excited to work on more challenges in the future!
